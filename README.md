# JinPingMei Reformatting

The sixteenth century novel 金瓶梅，*Jin Ping Mei*, also know in English as *The Plum in the Golden Vase*, is one of the greatest of Chinese novels, and an important work in world literature. But despite its artistic achievements and its household name, due to various reason it is underrepresented in many ways. 

For example, if a reader like me, whose experience with written Chinese language is primarily with Simplified Chinese, decide to read it, there will be some awkwardness:

1.  There is no uncensored Simplified Chinese publication of the book. They are also seldomly reprinted.

2.  There is not any ready-to-read Simplified Chinese digital version online.

3.  There are many free resources of the text in Traditional Chinese, but even if I can also comfortably read some Traditional Chinese, the novel has quite a lot of uncommon and dialectical words, so I would not want to power through this book googling words every sentence.

I converted the text file to Simplified Chinese and put them in seperate txt files by chapters.

The files are here:
